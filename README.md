# Calculator-Android-Jetpack-Comspose

Please find the sample app demonstrated today in this github repo. Feel free to tweak it, copy, and experiment with it for your benefit. The main files you need to
have in your Android Studio Project are the Calculator.kt and MainActivity.kt (custom names are accepted too). The android manifest file is added in this repo as well
on the rare occasion that your program doesnt run, in which case copying the complete contents of the manifest file could render a better response.
